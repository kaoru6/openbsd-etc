# replace ext0 with external interface name, 10.0.0.0/8 with internal network
# and 192.168.1.1 with external address
#
# nat: packets going out through ext0 with source address 10.0.0.0/8 will get
# translated as coming from 192.168.1.1. a state is created for such packets,
# and incoming packets will be redirected to the internal address.

# OpenBSD 3.1
#	Reload: /sbin/pfctl -N /etc/nat.conf -e

# OpenBSD 3.2:	Use instead pf.conf
